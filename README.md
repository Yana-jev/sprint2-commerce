# Sprint 2 IT Academy | Shop

## Introduction

This project is a demo version of a web application for an e-commerce company, designed to allow online product purchases. The application focuses on two main features:

Shopping Cart Management: Users can add, remove, and update items in their shopping cart.
Promotions: Discounts and promotions are applied to the final price during checkout.
The demo version is developed as part of a two-week sprint and is intended to showcase basic functionality for the client. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to manage a shopping cart and apply promotions, providing a foundation for further development.

Features
Shopping Cart: Add/remove/update items
Price Calculation: Application of promotions to adjust the final price

## Requirements


1. Clone this repo
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/starter-code-frontend-shop
```

2. Unlink your repo from the itacademy repository.
(Explanation: You have to upload the code to your GitHub repository, not to the IT Academy. That's why you have to unlink your project from IT Academy GitHub with the following command)

```bash
$ git remote rm origin
```

3. Link your repo to the repository you have to create in your github account
(Explanation: Now your project is not linked to any remote repository. In order to upload your code, you have to link your project to the new repository created on github.com using the following command)

```bash
$ git remote add origin <your repo name!>
```

## Submission

1. Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Sprint Solution"
$ git push origin master
```

2. Upload the link to the virtual campus so that your mentor can correct it and give you feedback.

- The logic to implement will be placed in the src/grocery.js and src/checkout.js files. You will see that the built in functions have already been created for you to implement them.

- It is forbidden to copy the code, since this way you don't learn anything. Furthermore, as you can see, the second release of sprint 5 is a mini-level test with the mentor, in which you will have to demonstrate live that you have acquired the javascript concepts. Don't worry, if you work on the releases you won't have any problems.
